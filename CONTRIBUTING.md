## 💻 Coding Standards

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Use type hints for all function arguments and return types.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Keep business logic in `app/api` and data models in `app/models`.

### Frontend (React & React Native)
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Keep components small and reusable.
- Ensure responsive design for both mobile (Expo) and web (Admin Dashboard).

### Documentation
- If you change logic, update `LOGIC.md`.
- If you add setup steps, update `README.md` or `ADMIN_SETUP.md`.

## 🏛️ Development Workflow
- **Naming Convention**: Use kebab-case for branch names (e.g., `feature/add-notifications`).
- **Commit Messages**: Be descriptive (e.g., `fix: resolve login authentication loop`).
